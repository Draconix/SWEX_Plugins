# SWEX Plugins

## Installation:
1. Downloaded desired plugin folder (ie. battle_reminder)
2. Place this folder in the plugins folder for SWEX
3. Start SWEX and enable the plugin in the settings tab
4. Restart SWEX

## Plugin Descriptions:
**Battle Reminder** - This plugin alerts the user when SWEX detects the end of a x10 repeat battle or raid.  It alerts the user with a popup and a ding (disable in config).

**Suggestions** - Please reach out with ideas!



### Note
Xzandro recommends .asar files for distribution (as opposed to folders).  This is ideal, and results in slightly smaller downloads. However, this has given me issues non-js dependencies (like the sound file used for the alert), so I'll use the unpackaged distributable until I find a solution.
